i) project based on user input. input is amount of ingredients (eg: flour, eggs, water) and output is whether bread can be made using those ingredients. 

ii) method is input variables (different ingredients) being compared to rules (the minimum/range of the amount of ingredients needed). if input variable is outside of boundary defined by rules, output is that bread cannot be made. if input variables is inside boundary defined by rules, output is that bread can be made. planning on using if & else statements. also planning on making user interface where amount of ingredients are listed and user can type in the amount (not sure how to do that). 

iii) need data on correct amount of ingredients to create boundary for rules. 

iv) expected outcome of project is that user can input amounts of given ingredients, those amounts are then compared to boundary defined by rules of how much of certain ingredients are needed to make bread. if all input variables are within boundray defined by rules, output would be that bread can be made. if some input variables are outsied of boundray defined by rules, output would be that bread cannot be made.
