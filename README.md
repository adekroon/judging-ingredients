# judging ingredients 
This project created a main function which uses user input to run functions. User input is amount of ingredients (eg: flour, eggs, water) or type of ingredients (eg: flour, oil). The main function uses several functions which compare user input to a standard value. These standard values define the 'correct' amount or type of ingredient needed to make simple bread. The program will output judgement on whether bread can be made from input repsonses. 

## how to run 
To run the project, Python will need to be installed. 
Then run the following command: 
```bash
python main.py
```
The program will run and will ask for user input for ingredients. Numbers should be entered numerically. Type of ingredients should be entered as a string.
